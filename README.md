# PWNServer

This is an idea I got from [IPPSEC](https://ippsec.rocks) which was to spin up a webserver with some useful tools at the beginning of CTF or job even because you know you'll probably need one. This one kind of got of hand, or maybe its just super useful, either way it does provide tools that I find handy in most jobs.

Currently **PWNServer** is focused on Linux targets. I will add Windows stuff at a later date.

## Requirements

This should work on just about any Linux system. It was developed on Python 3.9.12. It should run on earlier versions, but I haven't tested it on any.

## Installation

Get the code from github:

`
git clone https://github.com

I highly recommend you create a virtual environment for this app. It is very easy to do:

`
python3 -m venv .venv
